# Classification with an Academic Success Dataset
**Kaggle Playground June 2024**

[About the Tabular Playground Series](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e6/overview)

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

Goal: The goal of this competition is to predict academic risk of students in higher education

As a beginner in data science, I have done a lot of trial-and-errors through Hyperparameter Tuning and first-time trying Ensembling/Voting method! I also applied Deep Learning (Neural Networks) to my voting models.
> My accuracy score is 0.838 and placed in 147/2678 entries, making me *top 5%* of the leaderboard!
